            The Spirit and Opportunity rovers together represented NASA&apos;s
            Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER), part of the Mars Exploration
            Program. Launched about a month apart in 2003, the twin
            rovers&apos;s main scientific objective was to search for a range of
            rocks and soil types and then look for clues for past water activity
            on Mars. Each rover is about the size of a golf cart and seven times
            heavier (about 405 pounds or 185 kilograms) than the Sojourner rover
            launched on the Mars Pathfinder to Mars mission in 1996. Spirit and
            Opportunity were sent to opposite sides of Mars to locations that
            were suspected of having been affected by liquid water in the past.
            The plan was for the rovers to move from place to place, to perform
            geological investigations and to take photographs with mast-mounted
            cameras (about 5 feet or 1.5 meters off the ground) providing
            360-degree stereoscopic views of the terrain. A suite of instruments
            (MB, APXS, the magnets, MI and RAT) was deployed on a robotic arm
            (known as the instrument deployment device or IDD). The arm would
            place the instruments directly on the soil or rocks and activate the
            instruments. Spirit was launched first, at 17:58:47 UT June 10,
            2003, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The spacecraft was sent to an
            intermediate parking orbit around Earth (about 100 x 2,960 miles or
            163 x 4,762 kilometers) at a 28.5-degree inclination. Later, the
            PAM-D upper stage fired to send the spacecraft into a heliocentric
            orbit on a trajectory to intercept Mars. A course correction
            followed 10 days later. After three more corrections, the
            spacecraft&apos;s cruise stage carrying the Spirit rover approached
            Mars for landing Jan. 4, 2004. About 15 minutes before entering the
            Martian atmosphere, the lander, still inside its protective
            aeroshell, separated from the cruise stage. At an altitude of about
            4 to 5 miles (6 to 7.5 kilometers), a parachute deployed followed 30
            seconds later by the release of the aeroshell&apos;s bottom heat
            shield. Within another 10 seconds, the rover unreeled down a tether
            while still descending at a rate of 230 feet per second (70 meters
            per second). Four massive airbags, the same type used on Mars
            Pathfinder, inflated followed by the firing of the retrorockets at
            the base of the parachute. The rockets fired until the lander was
            about 28 feet (8.5 meters) off the ground. The retrorockets were
            needed because the atmosphere on Mars is less than 1% the density of
            Earth&apos;s and parachutes alone cannot reduce velocity. The entire
            rover package hit the Martian surface at 04:26 UT Jan. 4, 2004, at a
            velocity of about 46 feet per second (14 meters per second),
            bouncing 28 times before rolling to a stop about 820 to 980 feet
            (250 to 300 meters) from the point of first impact. Landing
            coordinates were 14.5692 degrees south latitude and 175.4729 degrees
            east longitude. The landing was about 8 miles (13.4 kilometers) from
            the planned target and inside the Gusev crater. The became known as
            Columbia Memorial Station to honor the seven astronauts killed when
            the Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart Feb. 1, 2003, as it returned
            to Earth. Initially, Spirit transmitted data to Earth via Mars
            Global Surveyor. About an hour-and-a-half after landing and after
            the airbags deflated, the rover deployed its petal solar panels and
            began relaying information via 2001 Mars Odyssey. Spirit immediately
            started transmitting spectacular images back to Earth. The rover ran
            into a major problem Jan. 21, 2004, when NASA&apos;s Deep Space
            Network lost contact. Due to a problem in Spirit&apos;s flash memory
            subsystem, the rover entered a fault mode. Fortunately, controllers
            were able to reformat the flash memory and send up a software patch
            (to preclude memory overload). Normal operations resumed Feb. 5. The
            next day, Spirit used its rock abrasion tool (RAT) to grind down the
            surface of a rock called Adirondack, a feat performed for the very
            first time on Mars. Investigating the exposed interior of the rock
            gave scientists important insights into the composition of Martian
            soil. The mission originally planned to last 90 Martian days, until
            about April 4, 2004. Yet, mission planners were able to repeatedly
            formulate extended missions well beyond the rover&apos;s original
            lifetime. Some of the subsequent highlights included a visit to
            Bonneville Crater, about 400 yards (370 meters) from its original
            landing point. The rover then went to the base of Columbia Hills
            where it spent an extended period of time. By 2005, Spirit began
            slowly making its way to the apex of Husband Hill, over terrain that
            was both rocky and sandy. It stopped at many locations to
            investigate, often using the RAT. In March 2005, a peculiar and
            strange event— the passing of dust devils that swept dust from the
            top of the solar panels— increased power coming to Spirit from the
            usual 60 percent to 93 percent, thus significantly extending the
            lifetime of the mission. On Sept. 29, 2005, the rover finally
            reached the summit of Husband Hill, a small flat plain from which
            Spirit was able to take 360-degree panoramas in true color of the
            Gusev Crater. Early the following year, the rover was directed to
            the north face of McCool Hill where it was assumed that Spirit would
            receive sufficient sunlight to maintain operations through the
            impending Martian winter. The trip to McCool Hill was eventually
            canceled, partly because a front wheel stopped working. This
            malfunction proved to be beneficial to scientists since the inactive
            wheel scraped off the upper layer of Martian soil as the rover
            moved, exposing bright silica-rich dust that indicated contact
            between soil and water. In early 2007, controllers uploaded new
            software to both Spirit and Opportunity. These new programs allowed
            the rovers to autonomously decide on a number of different actions,
            such as whether to transmit a particular image back to Earth or
            whether to extend the remote arm. Through much of the Earth summer
            of 2007, both Spirit and Opportunity faced massive dust storms that
            eroded their ability to operate effectively, mainly due to lack of
            power generated from the solar panels. At the end of 2008, a winter
            storm further reduced the output of Spirit&apos;s solar panel to
            about 89 watt-hours per Martian day. A normal amount would be about
            700 watt-hours per day. At such low levels, the rover had to use its
            own batteries and if they ran dry, it would basically end the
            mission. Through 2009, a series of fortuitous events—such as wind
            that blew dust off the solar panels—the rover&apos;s power slowly
            increased. By April 2009, the rover was back to about 372 watt-hours
            per day, sufficient for normal science activities to resume.
            Unfortunately, on May 1, 2009, while driving south beside the
            western edge of a low plateau called Home Plate, Spirit became stuck
            in soft soil, its wheels unable to generate traction against the
            ground. On Nov. 28, another of Spirit&apos;s six wheels, the right
            rear one, stopped working. By late January 2010, after many attempts
            to move Spirit had failed, mission planners reformulated the Spirit
            mission as a stationary science platform. One of its goals would now
            be to study the tiny wobbles in Mars&apos;s rotation to determine
            the nature of the planet&apos;s core—whether it is liquid or solid.
            To do that, however, the rover had to be tilted slightly to the
            north to expose its solar panels to the Sun, since the winter sun
            would be in the northern sky. In the end, the desired tilt was not
            achieved. After March 22, 2010, mission controllers at NASA&apos;s
            Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were not able to regain contact with
            Spirit. Despite more than 1,300 commands sent to Spirit, NASA
            officially concluded its recovery efforts May 25, 2011. The most
            probable cause of the loss of contact was the excessive cold that
            made its survival heaters ineffective. By the time it stopped,
            Spirit had traveled about 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers) across the
            Martian plains. It had operated for six years, two months and 19
            days, more than 25 times its original intended lifetime.
